# Leds, Pushbuttons, Potentiometer 

## Exercise 1: Toggle LED with Pushbutton

Write a program that turns on an LED when a pushbutton is pressed and turns it off when the button is released.

## Exercise 2: Control LED Brightness with Potentiometer

Write a program that uses a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED. As the potentiometer is turned, the LED should change brightness in proportion to the potentiometer's position.

## Exercise 3: Toggle LED Blink Mode with Pushbutton

Write a program that uses a pushbutton to switch between two different modes: one mode where the LED blinks at a fixed rate, and another mode where the LED blinks at a rate controlled by the potentiometer.

## Exercise 4: Cycle LED Colors with Pushbutton

Write a program that displays a sequence of colors on the RGB LEDs in response to pushbutton presses. Each press should cycle through the colors red, green, yellow, and then back to red.

## Exercise 5: Toggle LED Fade Mode with Pushbutton

Write a program that uses a pushbutton to switch between two different modes: one mode where the LED fades in and out at a fixed rate, and another mode where the LED fades in and out at a rate controlled by the potentiometer.

# Buzzer

## Exercise 6: Play a Sound with the Buzzer

Write a program that plays a sound on the buzzer when a pushbutton is pressed. You can use the tone() function to generate a specific frequency, or you can create your own melody using a series of tone() and delay() calls.

## Exercise 7: Control Buzzer Frequency with Potentiometer

Write a program that uses a potentiometer to control the frequency of the sound played by the buzzer. As the potentiometer is turned, the frequency of the sound should change in proportion to the potentiometer's position.

## Exercise 8: Toggle Buzzer Mode with Pushbutton

Write a program that uses a pushbutton to switch between two different modes: one mode where the buzzer plays a fixed sound, and another mode where the sound played by the buzzer is controlled by the potentiometer.

## Exercise 9: Control LED Color with Potentiometer

Write a program that uses a potentiometer to control the color of an RGB LED. As the potentiometer is turned, the LED should change color in proportion to the potentiometer's position. You can use the analogRead() function to read the potentiometer value and the analogWrite() function to control the intensity of each color channel on the LED.

## Exercise 10: Control LED Brightness and Buzzer Frequency Together

Write a program that uses both a potentiometer and a pushbutton to control an LED and a buzzer. The potentiometer should control the brightness of the LED, and the pushbutton should toggle between two different modes: one mode where the LED blinks at a fixed rate and the buzzer plays a fixed sound, and another mode where the LED blinks at a rate controlled by the potentiometer and the sound played by the buzzer is controlled by the potentiometer.
