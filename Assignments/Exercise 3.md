## Exercise 1: Toggle LED and Sound Buzzer with Pushbutton

Write a program that uses a state machine to control an LED and a buzzer. The LED should be on when the pushbutton is pressed and off when the button is released, and the buzzer should sound when the button is pressed and stop when it is released.

## Exercise 2: Cycle LED Colors and Sound Different

 Frequencies with Write a program that uses a state machine to control an RGB LED and a buzzer. The LED should cycle through a sequence of colors (red, green, blue) when the pushbutton is pressed, and the buzzer should sound with a different frequency for each color.

## Exercise 3: Control LED Brightness and Buzzer Frequency with Potentiometer

Write a program that uses a state machine to control an LED and a buzzer based on the position of a potentiometer. The LED should change brightness in proportion to the potentiometer's position, and the buzzer should sound with a frequency that is also proportional to the potentiometer's position.

## Exercise 4: Control LED and Buzzer with Potentiometer and Pushbutton

Write a program that uses a state machine to control an LED and a buzzer based on the position of a potentiometer and the state of a pushbutton. The LED should change brightness in proportion to the potentiometer's position when the button is pressed, and the buzzer should sound with a frequency that is also proportional to the potentiometer's position. When the button is released, the LED should turn off and the buzzer should stop.

## Exercise 5: Create a Complex State Machine Program

Write a program that uses a state machine to control an LED and a buzzer in a more complex way, such as by implementing a simple game or interactive device. For example, you could create a "Simon Says" game where the LED and buzzer follow a sequence of colors and sounds that the user has to repeat, or a "musical instrument" where the LED and buzzer respond to different combinations of button presses and potentiometer positions.
