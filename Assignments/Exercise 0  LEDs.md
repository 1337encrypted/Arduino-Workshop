# LEDs

## Exercise 1: Blink an LED with `digitalWrite`

- Connect an LED to a digital output pin D3 on your Arduino board.
- Use the `digitalWrite` function to turn the LED on and off. 
- You can use the `delay` function to add a delay between turning the LED on and off for 500 milli seconds.

## Exercise 2: Fade an LED with `analogWrite`

- In this exercise, you will learn how to control the brightness of an LED using Arduino.
- Connect an LED to a digital output pin D5 on your Arduino board
- Use the `analogWrite` function to adjust the brightness of the LED.
- Use `delay` function for 10ms to create a fading effect.

## Exercise 3: Use preprocessor Macro `ledPin`

- Create an preprocessor macro named *ledPin* and assign it to pin number 5.
- Turn on the led for 500 milli seconds and print "Led is on"
- Turn off the led and 500 milli seconds and print "Led is off"

## Exercise 4: Control multiple LEDs with digitalWrite

- Connect several LEDs to different digital output pins *D3, D4, D5* on your Arduino board.
- Use the `digitalWrite` function to turn them on and off individually in a sequential order. 

## Exercise 5: Create a traffic light

- In this exercise, you will use the `digitalWrite` function to create a traffic light circuit with three LEDs. 
- Connect three LEDs to different digital output pins *redLed on D3, yellowLed on D4, greenLed on D5* off your Arduino board 
- Use the `digitalWrite` function to control the sequence in which the LEDs turn on and off, creating a traffic light effect. 
- Print *STOP, GET READY, GO, GET READY TO STOP* respectively on appropriate led lights.
- You can use the `delay` function to add a delay between each step of the sequence.

## Exercise 6: Create a binary 4 bit counter
- Use digital pins D6, D5, D4, D3 to hookup the board
